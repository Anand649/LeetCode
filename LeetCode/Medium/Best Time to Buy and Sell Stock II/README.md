## Problem Description

<p>You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold <strong>at most one</strong> share of the stock at any time. However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the <strong>same day</strong>, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.</p>

<p>Find and return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> profit you can achieve</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

Common DP algorithm framework and recommended learning path](https://vocus.cc/article/66616aeffd89780001cab1da)

Our goal:
Maximize trading profit with at most single long position(\u6BCF\u500B\u6642\u523B\u6700\u591A\u6301\u6709\u4E00\u500B\u591A\u982D\u90E8\u4F4D) on every moment.

Method_#1
O(n) sol by DP + state machine

Define "**Hold**" as the state of **holding stock**. (\u6301\u6709\u80A1\u7968)
Define "**NotHold**" as the state of **keep cash**. (\u6301\u6709\u73FE\u91D1)

General rule aka recursive relationship.

```
DP[Hold] 
= max(keep holding stock, or just buy stock & hold today)
= max( DP[Previous Hold], DP[previous NotHold] - stock price)
```
---

```
DP[NotHold] 
= max(keep cash, or just sell out stock today)
= max( DP[Previous NotHold], DP[previous Hold] + stock price)
```

Some reader may argue it is not DP,
but for me it is.
Each state depends on early states, and there are overlapped subproblem.

If you would like to see more traditional DP-style code with multiple dimension, here is the code.

Some reader feels that DP is an over-kill for Best time to buy and sell stock II.
I confess it is, but I just want to show that we can solve all Leetcode\'s stock trading problem series in DP thinking process with state machine transfer in a general way.


```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # Use constant literal to help reader understand source code below.
        HOLD_STOCK, KEEP_CASH = 0, 1

        ## Dictionary (Hash table)
        # key: (day, state) pair
        # value: coreesponding maximal profit
        dp = {}

        # No free lunch, it is impoosible to have stock before first trading day
        dp[-1, HOLD_STOCK] = -math.inf

        # No gain, no loss before first trading day
        dp[-1, KEEP_CASH] = 0

        # For each day with corresponding stock price in stock market
        for day, stock_price in enumerate(prices):

            # If today we have stock, either we already had it yesterday, or we just buy stock and hold it today.
            dp[day, HOLD_STOCK] = max( dp[day-1, HOLD_STOCK], dp[day-1, KEEP_CASH] - stock_price)

            # If today we keep cash, either we already kept cash yesterday, or we just sell out stock today
            dp[day, KEEP_CASH] = max( dp[day-1, KEEP_CASH], dp[day-1, HOLD_STOCK] + stock_price)
        
        #---------------------------------------------------------------
        # To get maximal realized profit, final state must be KEEP_CASH.
        last_day = len(prices)-1
        return dp[last_day, KEEP_CASH]
```

Method_#2
O(n) sol by Greedy

Share another O(n) solution by price gain collection with **greedy** value taking concept.

Max profit with [long position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)) ,\'\u505A\u591A\' in chinese, is met by **collecting all price gain** in the stock price sequence.

Take care that holding **multiple position at the same time is NOT allowed** by [description](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/).
